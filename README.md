# Simple WebSocket Frontend

This React application provides a minimal interface for testing WebSocket endpoints.
It is built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app opens in development mode. Enter your WebSocket endpoint, connect, and start sending messages.
